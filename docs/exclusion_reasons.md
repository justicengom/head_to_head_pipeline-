This document is for noting the reason(s) for a sample's exclusion from the project

## mada_1-45

DNA Extract 1 is missing nanopore data  
DNA Extract 2 did not have enough DNA for Illumina

Effectively, this means the Illumina and nanopore data is not exactly matched. However, 
the nanopore data we do have is very scarse (92Mb of data).

## R32273

The pairing of the Illumina data for this sample is incorrect. I.e. if you sort the reads 
by sequence identifier, the first reads in R1 do not match those in R2.

## R32258

The pairing of the Illumina data for this sample is incorrect. I.e. if you sort the reads 
by sequence identifier, the first reads in R1 do not match those in R2.
