## mada_1-45

DNA Extract 1 is missing nanopore data  
DNA Extract 2 did not have enough DNA for Illumina

Effectively, this means the Illumina and nanopore data is not exactly matched.

## mada_1-27

DNA Extract 1 is missing nanopore data  
DNA Extract 2 did not have enough DNA for Illumina

Effectively, this means the Illumina and nanopore data is not exactly matched.

## mada_108

DNA Extract 1 is missing nanopore data  
DNA Extract 2 did not have enough DNA for Illumina

Effectively, this means the Illumina and nanopore data is not exactly matched.

## mada_119

DNA Extract 1 is missing nanopore data  
DNA Extract 2 did not have enough DNA for Illumina

Effectively, this means the Illumina and nanopore data is not exactly matched.

## mada_1-4

DNA Extract 1 is missing nanopore data  
DNA Extract 2 did not have enough DNA for Illumina

Effectively, this means the Illumina and nanopore data is not exactly matched.

## mada_149

DNA Extract 1 is missing nanopore data  
DNA Extract 2 did not have enough DNA for Illumina

Effectively, this means the Illumina and nanopore data is not exactly matched.

## mada_138

DNA Extract 1 is missing nanopore data  
DNA Extract 2 did not have enough DNA for Illumina

Effectively, this means the Illumina and nanopore data is not exactly matched.

## mada_2-24

DNA Extract 1 is missing nanopore data  
DNA Extract 2 did not have enough DNA for Illumina - but has good nanopore  
DNA Extract 3 failed for nanopore - but Illumina worked  

Effectively, this means the Illumina and nanopore data is not exactly matched.

## R32273

The pairing of the Illumina data for this sample is incorrect. I.e. if you sort the reads 
by sequence identifier, the first reads in R1 do not match those in R2.

## R32258

The pairing of the Illumina data for this sample is incorrect. I.e. if you sort the reads 
by sequence identifier, the first reads in R1 do not match those in R2.

There is also no nanopore data for this sample.

## mada_1-34

After the first round of baseline variant calling it appears as though the nanopore data
for this sample does not match the Illumina. More information can be found [here][40].
